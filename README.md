# Systematizer

A Windows address book, calendar, and to-do list optimized for people whose executive function style is similar to the author. The author forgets stuff,
so it has to be recorded immediately in structured lists.

Executive functioning main points:

* Everything is in a vertical list with the most important at the top.
* To-do items are interspersed with scheduled calendar items, rather than in separate lists.
* Nothing "goes away" without explicit user action.
* Today's schedule is shown in chunks so you can plan the day in parts like desk work, errands, house work, etc.
* Daily reminders like taking medications are not cluttery.
* One-click note taking so you can track interruptions and not lose the earlier thing or the interrupting thing.

Some nice features:

* Formatted notes
* Four views for planning ahead: Today, Tomorrow, Agenda (appointments in the upcoming weeks at a glance) and Calendar (long term planning).
* People and tasks can be linked in several ways.
* People can be categorized hierarchically, so you can see a list of family, or mechanics.
* Outline of notes to store accounts, vendor info, and other miscellany.
* Quick click from task to associated web sites with password management.
* Highlighted tasks are used for trips and other multi-day tasks, and you can plan the next months and years easily.
* Repeated tasks include several patterns and can support exceptions.
* File integration allows you to set up Windows folders and files that correspond with tasks/sub-tasks, so you can quickly open related files, or create them from templates.
* Email integration allows you to store emails in tasks to clean up inbox and defer dealing with those emails.
* Import/export

Some design points:

* This is offline first because you can't afford to have your calendar depend on the internet.
* Plan for mobile and other platforms (not implemented); each will use the same database format for compatibility.
* Multiple databases - you decide where to store them and are responsible for backups.
